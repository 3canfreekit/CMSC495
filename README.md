GitHub Repository Structure for Team 3 - Ma√Ætre d' Project 

Our GitHub repository has been organized to facilitate clear and efficient collaboration across all aspects of our project development. Here's the structure that we'll be following: 

 

Root Directory: 

Contains the README.md file which provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines. 

 

/docs: 

This directory houses all our project documentation, such as meeting minutes (/meeting_minutes), project plans (/project_plans), user guides (/user_guides), and requirements specifications (/requirements_specs). 

/design: 

In this directory, we keep all our design-related files. The /wireframes subdirectory contains the wireframes for our UI/UX design, and /mockups has the mockup files. 

/src: 

The source code of our project resides here, split into three main parts: /frontend for front-end code, /backend for back-end code, and /common for code and resources shared between front and back ends. 

 

/database: 

This directory includes everything related to our database, with /schemas for the database schema files and /seeds for seeding the database with initial data for development. 

 

/tests: 

All our test cases and test scripts are located here, with separate subdirectories for unit tests (/unit) and integration tests (/integration). 

 

/build: 

Contains build scripts and related files that help automate the build and deployment process. 

 

/api: 

Here we store our API documentation, which is crucial for understanding how to interact with our backend services. 

 

Each directory includes a .gitkeep file to maintain the structure in Git, as Git does not track empty folders. 

As we progress, we might add or modify this structure to better suit our needs. All team members are encouraged to pull the latest changes before adding or modifying files to ensure consistency across local development environments. 

Let's make sure to maintain this structure and store files in their respective directories to keep our repository clean and navigable!
